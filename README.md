# Sudoku Solver

## What the app does!

Sudoku Solver is a app that allows user to enter a Sudoku board unfinished and see the solution.
There is a start page that prompts the user to enter a unfinished sudoku board a with a submit button.
Once the submit button is pressed the finished board is printed onto the screen as well as a message and a reset button
If the program is unable to solve the board it will let the user know and breaks so the app dose not run too long.
If the user want to try a different board the reset button allows the user to move back to the input form and try again
